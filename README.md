# Lung-Cancer-detection-using-Transfer-Learning
I have implemented a project of 'Lung Caner Classification using pre-trained VGG16 model' which is a transfer learning technique. VGG16 model has been trained on 'imagine' dataset which consist of 13 convolutional layers and 3 FC layers. Hence freezing the Conv Layers and building the FC layers.  Model Accuracy: 97%
